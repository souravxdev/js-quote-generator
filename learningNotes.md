### CSS Rules

-   cdn : content delivery network

-   box-sizing : border-box; any time we add padding to any element, what can happen is that padding will stretch the page, let's say that we have a page that was 100% of the view ports width, and if we added padding to something, it would make that more than 100% and it will force a horizontal scrollbar. So box-sizing prevents that from happening because it prevents padding from adding extra width or extra height to the page.

-   Normally there is a 10px marging all around the body, if we don't want this, we can set up margin: 0; in the body.

-   vh : view port height, full height of the entire window that we are in, we wat to stretch our background at least full height of the screen even if the content isn't enough to take up the full height of the screen.

-   fab : font awesome icons for brands, the class we use for any kind of social media or tech company.

-   rgba() : The a, alpha value allows us to control the opacity of the object.

-   rem : Relative size comparing to the root element spacificall the html element, most browsers that will have a default value of 16 pixels, that 16 pixel value that can become bigger on a mobile device when a user scales their text bigger, rem helps us to maintain a consitent and responsive design. 1 rem = 16 px, 2.75 rem = 44 px

-   media query : We add media queries add the bottom of the style file cause we want it to be able to override anything else throughout the code.

-   An asynchronous function can run at any time independently, and it won't stop the browser from completing the loading of a page.

-   So we will need to write async function then we will name our function.
