### CSS Rules
- box-sizing : border-box; any time we add padding to any element, what can happen is that padding will stretch the page, let's say that we have a page that was 100% of the view ports width, and if we added padding to something, it would make that more than 100% and it will force a horizontal scrollbar. So box-sizing prevents that from happening because it prevents padding from adding extra width or extra height to the page.

- Normally there is a 10px marging all around the body, if we don't want this, we can set up margin: 0; in the body.

- vh : view port height, full height of the entire window that we are in, we wat to stretch our background at least full height of the screen even if the content isn't enough to take up the full height of the screen.
